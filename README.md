# ENALI
A modern 3D-powered landing page crafted for developers, with sleek UI and interactive visuals.
Enali is a modern 3D landing page built with HTML, CSS, and model-viewer.
It features a sleek interface and a rotating 3D model to create a visual-first experience.
The design is fully responsive and styled with custom UI elements.
This is my first experiment with integrating 3D assets into a real-time web environment.
Itâ€™s crafted for developers who appreciate both design and interactivity.
